### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my special repository! My name is Patrick Spillane (he/him) and I am a Senior Biology Major (B.A) at Stonehill College. 
I hope to go into Graduate School to study Ecology and eventually work in the Ecology field. Perhaps maybe even get a doctorate to help with my studies and job opportunites. 
Throughout my life I have always been very interested in the natural world and  My advisor recommended a Biology course known as R Programming for Biologists that took place over the summer, I then decided to sign up for the class and very quickly learned the ins and outs of R programming. This class overall helped expand my horizons and helped me learn alot and be able to acheive new career paths I did not think were possible.
My portfolio repository has several of my homeworks and my main Function Tutorial project.
